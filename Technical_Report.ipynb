    "- particle neighbours, `adj list`\n",
    "- particles acceleration, or change in velocity, `a_i`\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section will introduce how Forward Euler and Predictor Corrector method are implementing these changes through the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Forward Euler\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial implementation of the SPH simulator uses a Forward Euler timestepping scheme. It timesteps the particle's position, velocity and density. This timestepping method is used in `sph_fe`. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{x}_{i}^{t+1} = {x}_{i}^{t} + {\\Delta t}{v}_{i}^{t}\\\\\\\\\n",
    "{v}_{i}^{t+1} = {v}_{i}^{t} + {\\Delta t}{a}_{i}^{t}\\\\\\\\\n",
    "{\\rho}_{i}^{t+1} = {\\rho}_{i}^{t} + {\\Delta t}{D}_{i}^{t}\\\\\\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow chart below is a visual representation of the different operations takinf place during each timestep of the SPH simulator. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./report_diagrams/fwd_euler.png\" width=500x>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Forward Euler gives promising results and allows for a good visualisation of the flow's behaviour. It however require very small time step in order to work and is only first order accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optimisation of the `finding neighbours` method was implemented in `sph_fe`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Predictor-Corrector Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The second and improved implemtation of the SPH simulator makes use of an Imporoved Euler time stepping schemes. This time stepping solution is second order accurate, and is used in both file `sph_ie` and `sph_ap`. The `sph_ap` module has additional methods, to implement the artificial pressure on the SPH simulator. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Predictor Corrector method takes the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./report_diagrams/imp_euler.png\" width=500x>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge of implementing this method was saving the temporary value for particle i and j. While different lists were cosidered, the best implementation was to add `x_temp`, `v_temp` and `rho_temp` as attributes of the particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "These additions included adding a few changes to the main code, such as adding a `step` parameter to the `dW` function. This is because in the second step, when `a`, `D`, `dW` and LJ forces are calculated in the double for loop, the value of x that needs to be considered for `r_ij` and `v_ij` is that `x_temp`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation worked easily and required little changes to the main code. \n",
    "\n",
    "For further improvements to the Predictor Corrector method, the two for loops should be made into methods that are called for the two stages of the PC timestepping. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Find Neighbours\n",
    "\n",
    "A find_neighbours was given and used for early simulations. This method worked well, however as the largest time restraint on this simulation is looping over all neighbours for all particles we should look to optimise the code here. As the derivative equations are either symmetric (density) or anti-symmetric (velocity) we can consider the interaction of particle i on particle j abd the interaction of particle j on particle i at the same time. This halves the nuber of particles we have to iterate over and improves run time by $\\sim40-50\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new method developped here, is implemented by only considering half of the particles neightbours, requiering a new find_neighbours function where only the highlighted grid points below are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./report_diagrams/l_shape.png\" width=200x>\n",
    "\n",
    "we also need to consider the centre grid cell neighbours, however we must be careful to only consider each particle pair once (i.e. we need an asymetrical criteria so that we include the interaction when looking at particle i but not when looking at particle j). The best way to gaurentee this is used the particles ID numbers: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if ID_i > ID_j:\n",
    "    consider interaction\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is computationally cheap (they are only ever relativly small integers) and ensures the interactions will never be considered twice. In terms of equations whenever we add one of the summations terms to the accleration of particle i we also subtract it from particle j and we add the density term to both i and j as well. The only other algorithmic change this requiers is to reset the deriatives for all particles at the end of a timestep so we can add sumattion terms for any particle in the next step before they are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grid Initialisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid allocation was immproved to suit better with a front end code. The new gird initialisation works by running a series of methods in the main class. This new method also ensures that there are no overlapping particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user input to create the grid consists of \n",
    "- x_max, upper corner of the domain\n",
    "- x_min, lower corner of the domain\n",
    "- f(x, y), which gives coordinates a value of 1 when a particle is present and 0 when the spaceis empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The f(x, y) function is written as inequalities for the case example, such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    " def f(x, y):\n",
    "    if 0 <= y <= 2 or (0 <= x <= 3 and 0 <= y <= 5):\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
