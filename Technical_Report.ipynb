    "## Grid Initialisation\n",

    "The grid allocation was immproved to suit better with a front end code. The new gird initialisation works by running a series of methods in the main class. This new method also ensures that there are no overlapping particles.\n",

    "The user input to create the grid consists of \n",
    "- x_max, upper corner of the domain\n",
    "- x_min, lower corner of the domain\n",

    "\n",
